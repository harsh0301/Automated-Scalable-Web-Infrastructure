# Infrastructure as a code

This AWS CloudFormation template streamlines the creation of essential AWS resources for network and application deployment. It establishes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets spanning multiple Availability Zones, ensuring secure and scalable infrastructure. The template also configures an Internet Gateway for internet access, route tables for proper traffic routing, and deploys EC2 instances with user data scripts for setup, including AWS CloudWatch Agent installation. Additionally, it creates an S3 bucket with encryption and lifecycle policies, sets up an RDS database, defines IAM roles and policies for resource access, configures a Route 53 DNS record for an EC2 instance, and integrates an Amazon SNS topic and Lambda function for email verification. This comprehensive template expedites the setup of a robust AWS environment for network and application deployment.
